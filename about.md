This personal website sets an informative goal achieved by means of boiling down simple topics to articles that can be portably read accompanying a good cup of *Coffee* or *Latte Macchiato* and a cookie, or whatever is the *fika* choice of the day! 

By posting a number of articles on topics in Data Science and Physics I hope to reflect my vigorous interest in these areas. In fact, I will attempt to connect this two fascinating areas wherever possible and highlight the parallels in the long run. To afford this I outsourced all the basic mathematical proofs and elementary concepts to be looked up in the respective literature. Some mathematical understanding is a prerequisite, since the articles address Data Scientists and Physicists on common terms :) I would also like to encourage you to make use of my scripts that can be found in the section *Resources* and are in general work in progress. 

Therefore, in the design of the articles it was important to me to highlight the connections of concepts to provoke creative thinking. I hope this structure can facilitate the gradual illumination of the topics in a reasonable amount of time and provide enablement to come up with new ideas. 

Furthermore, the articles are divided into three difficulty levels, based on some arbitrary criteria: basic, intermediate and advanced. The difficulty category is a hint on the order in which the articles can be consumed for the possible speed up of the learning curve. 

Welcome, *v√§lkommen* and enjoy!
