This website results from the idea to boil down simple topics in Machine Learning to articles which can be portably read accompanying a good cup of *Coffee* or *Latte Macchiato* and a cookie, or whatever is the day's choice in the spirit of Swedish *fika* tradition. 

To achieve this I outsourced the mathematical proofs and elementary concepts to be looked up in the respective literature. Basic mathematical understanding is a prerequisite. Said this, I would like to encourage you to also make use of my scripts which can be found in the section *Resources*. In the design of the articles it was important to me to highlight the connections of concepts, which can be the drive for first creative thinking. I hope this structure can facilitate the gradual illumination of the topics in a reasonable amount of time and provide enablement to come up with new ideas. 

The articles are divided into three difficulty levels, based on some arbitrary criteria: basic, intermediate and advanced. The difficulty category is also a hint, and not necessity, on the order in which the articles can be consumed. 

Welcome, *v√§lkommen* and enjoy!
