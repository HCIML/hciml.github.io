This website is work in progress and sets an informative goal by reducing topics in Data Science and Physics to short articles that can be portably read accompanying a cup of *Coffee* or *Latte Macchiato* and a cookie, or whatever is the *fika* choice of the day! 

It is also an attempt to connect these two fascinating research areas and highlight the numerous parallels. To afford this all the basic mathematical proofs and elementary concepts are outsourced to be looked up in the respective literature. Basic mathematical understanding is a prerequisite since the articles address Data Scientists and Physicists on common terms. The reader is encouraged to make use of the section *Resources* where some of my lecture scripts can be found. In the design of the articles, it was important to me to highlight the connections of concepts to induce interdisciplinary thinking. I hope that this structure will facilitate the gradual illumination of the topics in a reasonable amount of time and provide enablement to come up with new ideas.

Furthermore, the articles are divided into three difficulty levels, based on some arbitrary criteria: basic, intermediate, and advanced. The difficulty category is a hint on the order in which the articles can be consumed for the possible speed-up of the learning curve.

Welcome, *v√§lkommen* and enjoy!
