This website emerged from the idea to boil down simple topics in machine learning to an article which can be portably read accompanying a good cup of *Coffee* or *Latte Macchiato*, or whatever is the day's choice for the Swedish *fika* tradition. 

To achieve this I outsourced the mathematical proofs and elementary concepts to be looked up in the respective literature. Basic mathematical understanding is a prerequisite. 

What counted more for me in the design of the articles is the connection of concepts, which, for me, is the main drive of creative thinking, coming up with new ideas and grasping the whole picture in a reasonable amount of time. 

The articles are divided into three difficulty levels, which is basic, intermediate and advanced, based on some arbitrary criteria. The category might might also hint on the order, in which the articles might be consumed. 

Welcome, *v√§lkommen* and enjoy!
